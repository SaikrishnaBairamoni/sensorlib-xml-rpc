# CARLA Sensor Library

## Overview

The sensor library provides a proxy sensor for the CARLA simulator, exposing additional features.

This new feature is provided to enable object detection for CDASim deployment using CARLA's existing sensor and object
representation. The data will be feed to the CARMA-Platform via the CARLA CARMA Integration tool, and to CDASim to
expose the data to other integrated simulators or software systems under test.

The SimulatedSensor acts as a wrapper to the CARLA Semantic Lidar Sensor, capturing the data and performing
post-processing to generate a list of detected objects upon request. The primary reason for processing data from CARLA
is to ensure noise is applied to the output signal, and customization is possible for occlusion and any other procedures
in the future. The native CARLA sensor does not provide signal noise, misdetection simulation, or customization.

Raw sensor observations from the CARLA sensor are analyzed to build a dataset representing the current objects in scene.

_Note: CARLA version 0.9.10 contains an internal bug that causes object misidentification. A bug fix has been added to the current sensor._

## Carla CDA Sim Adapter

The Carla CDA Sim Adapter exposes the sensing capability through an RPC service. See
the [Carla CDA Sim Adapter Documentation](doc/CarlaCDASimAdapter.md) for details.

## Carla CDA Sim API

For internal data access from Python code, refer to
the [Carla CDA Sim API Documentation](doc/CarlaCDASimAPI.md).

## Operation

The SimulatedSensor manages a CarlaSensor, which is a light wrapper around the CARLA sensor reference.

High-speed LIDAR data is collected into a DataCollector class running in a separate context which self-populates via a
callback.

The SimulatedSensor.compute_detected_objects() function exposes the primary processing sequence performing the
following stages:

1. Truth state retrieval.
2. Pre-filter by distance from sensor, and allowed object types.
3. LIDAR hitpoint retrieval.
4. Occlusion filtering.
5. Application of a generic noise model to the results.

Internal functions build a list of DetectedObjects, representing the detected vulnerable road users. Range and angular
extent are collected in lookup structures which are passed between functions as needed.

### Configuration

Configurability is provided to the SimulatedSensor including parameters related to: Pre-filtering, occlusion, and the
noise model. Configuration parameters are required in the SemanticLidarSensor constructor, and available to load from
included configuration files.

### Truth State Retrieval

The CARLA World.get_actors() function exposes actors in the simulation. These are immediately transformed into
DetectedObject instances.

### Pre-Filtering

Objects not of the permitted type are removed, along with objects outside the maximum range of the sensor.

### LIDAR Hitpoint Retrieval

Data are collected via the SensorDataCollector.__collect_sensor_data() function, which is registered as a callback in
the CARLA sensor. Processing frames are collected into "active" and "previous" queue positions, are understood to
consist of one full LIDAR sensor rotation. Data contains vertical scan elements.

### Occlusion Filtering

Objects which are occluded by other items in the scene are filtered out.

Occlusion is determined from a fractional threshold pertaining to the number of LIDAR hitpoints detected divided by the
number expected.

To account for inaccuracies in these calculations due to beam spreading at larger distances, a scaling factor is applied
to the threshold. The nominal threshold and scaling parameters are configurable.

### Noise Model
The noise model applies adjustments to the output data including positions, orientations, and whether the object has
been detected.

The noise model interface is extensible and can support additional models in the future.
